      "\tTrigger: All you guys chasing each other around in an edit war, sometimes just to piss on the other guy, creating puppets, endless reverts, pointless name-calling...etc. Stop! Go somewhere else. Go to a Taiwan\\China discussion forum on the internet or take it outside. I don't want to see it here anymore. Wikipedia does not have a Wiki-kids encyclopedia yet, so until then, don't contribute. You guys chase each other all over wikipedia looking for a fight and then get all primed for conflict, so when a guy like me comes along to add quality information from quality sources, I have to put up with a bunch of impulsive, angry, POV people, who, because of conflict with someone I don't even know, or care to know, can't/won't cooperate. I am really beginning to think you all enjoy the fighting and perpetuate it. Would someone please take the high road? This page has the potential to be a really great, really useful, really informative page...but that is not going to happen if you keep fighting. I am willing to put in the effort and make this happen and I want everyone to have a part in it, but this page will continue to be a nothing-waste-of-time for you and for me if you keep it up. How long have you spent getting nowhere on this? Could you use this time better? I am looking to cooperate with people who can operate in good faith and are not looking to push any POV. I have a good background in this field and could lend a hand for good NPOV articles. I could be a good ally down the road for future cooperation, but I do not want to work in such a negative environment with suspicion over every edit. Again, Stop and breathe..... \n",

In a nutshell, my outside view noted: A request for CU to prove you were a sockpuppet.  Checkuser determined that by IP, Location, and presumably other unmentioned technical means (of which they do have), that there was no match between your location and the computer(s) you use, and the location and computer(s) that COM uses. A Wikistalk report that looked damning at first, until put in perspective:  The accuser had more overlap with COM than you. Indisputable evidence that you must be COM because you won't outright deny it...which you now clearly have.. The bottom line is that once you were focused on, despite the fact that the allegations were countered with facts, you were still railroaded. I'm not sure that your account can be salvaged.

      "\t\t\tReply:  As the same information is mostly repeated on three pages: BUPC, wiki_link, and wiki_link, there is no purpose in having this page. I moved any unique information to the pages on Chase and Jensen. Besides that, the only verifiable and reliable sources are the research by Balch and the opinion of the Montana Supreme Court, both of which indicate declining activity and membership. Balch states there was a membership list with less than 86 members in 1994, and he further says that the rate of defection accelerated in the 1990s.  The relevance of these pages stands primarily on the failed prophecies, and the research published in Stone's book, which is focused around the individuals of Jensen and Chase, not as a coherent religious community. With a complete absence of verifiable and reliable sources indicating that there is currently a community outside of a small handful of individuals, I don't see how you can justify keeping this page. The historical relevance and presence of a schismatic sect is entirely contained in Leland Jensen's article and the wiki_link page.  ☼ -\n",

If five experienced editors tell you that your edit is bad and nobody agrees with you, maybe you should consider the possibility that there is a problem with the edit rather than just repeatedly reverting.  As for the edit itself, normally small sourcing or language issues could be worked out in discussion but the material and phrasing you are trying to add is such an obvious violation of WP:BLP and WP:RS that it's a non-starter.  It's doubtful you'll get any support whatsoever from the Wiki community, even from those editors that agree with you ideologically.  \n",

Whereas you object to \"queer\" with or without its negative uses, you embrace \"homosexual\" while turning a blind eye to its ambiguous status due to negative uses and connotations (medicalization, anti-gay linguistic practice, etc.). How contradictory. Please take your beefs with language change to some forum as this article and the LGBT series template are not a sounding boards for your emotional bias.

In my opinion, accusing another editor being anti-LGBT (i.e., accusing that editor of homophobia) is crossing a very serious line, particularly when you offer no real evidence that the target of your accusation is motivated by opposition to homosexuality or gay culture itself and no such motivation is immediately self-evident in that editor's commentary.  Really, is this an issue that merits this level of vitriol?  If so, I would have to say that it takes two to tango and any strong emotional investment you may have in the label LGBT is as likely to contribute to the conflict as any other editor's imputed bias.\n",
      " To offer a constructive outcome, may I suggest another route to resolving the conflict? Rather than arguing over replacing \"LGBT\" with \"homosexual\", which does not appear to offer any possible outcome upon which we can form consensus, can we then address the other side of the equation and replace \"heterosexual\" with \"straight\"?  This would resolve what I see as the valid kernel of 's objection (preserving clarity and consistency by contrasting a cultural-identity label to a cultural-identity label), and it does so without giving the appearance of indulging in \"erasure\".   \n",

If we take into account that difference--that people report significantly higher levels of sexual assault that is not criminally liable--then if anything, that would mean that the false-accusation rate for men would scale off that lower \"criminal-oriented\" number, while the victimization rate for women would include instances of coercion, incapacity, manipulation, etc. Odds ratio just becomes more slanted for men.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Don't try to change their minds. Don't approach a debate with the attitude that you're going to, either. Try to understand why they feel the way they do. Bernie Sanders did this, and that's why he had such a successful campaign. Acknowledge that the establishment democrats have ignored them. Listen to their problems, and don't just write them off as \"not voting in their self interest\" or worse, \"unintelligent\". Statistics show that the people you take your car to, or call to fix your sink, or electric, when you *don't know how to*, mostly vote for Trump. College education is not a prerequisite for intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. I'm not sure what you mean by \"they wouldn't have sympathy if the roles were reversed\". You cite some stereotypes about Trump supporters (anti-women, anti-minority, anti-homosexual, etc), saying they wouldn't be sympathetic to people in those groups... Yet Trump got a lot of support from people in those exact groups. Are you trying to argue that you shouldn't care about them since you think they wouldn't care about you? No wonder you think it's a waste of time to debate them. Because with your views, it is. Nobody's gonna wanna debate someone who views them in such a concrete, inflexible, and negative light. You know how they talk about \"liberal smugness\"? I have some news for you...\n",
      "\n",
      "3. You say *\"Trump supporters are not useful for a debate given their indifference to reality, consistency and truth. It may seem harsh to dismiss the political opinions of millions but aside from the obvious point that Clinton received more votes, TS do not represent a majority of America. In fact, they are probably less educated and in a bigger relative decline than most other demographic groups.* Once again, the \"problems\" you cite are all entirely because of how you view them. The \"Alternative facts\" trend, and \"Fake news\" isn't complete bullshit. There's been blatantly obvious manipulation of how stories are reported, particularly by the major media outlets. Spin on news is nothing new, it's just that nobody's called it out before. You talk about \"uncovering truth\" - Doing so means calling things out with they misrepresent something. A prime example of this is when CNN alleged that Trump called for the assassination of Clinton, because they chose to interpret a vague statement by him in the most extreme way possible. That's dishonest and deserves to be outed as such. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. This argument is the cherry on the top of your, to be blunt, incredibly self-oblivious view. Not a single Trump supporter I've talked to or I know has EVER implied that they are the ONLY group in this country with issues. You immediately dismiss them because racism and sexism, and you claim that it's totally impossible to address their concerns AND racism and sexism. This literally tells Trump supporters that you don't care about them, and they have no valid opinion because they're all racists and sexists. I cannot believe how dense that is. It's pointless to debate someone when your entire attitude and view is \"I don't care about you at all in any way\".\n",

      "\n",
      "So I tried to avoid being too personal, and I'll try to be as respectful as possible when I say this: The problem isn't Trump supporters, it's you. It's YOUR opinion and views, not theirs, that makes it a waste of time to debate them. Take a note from Bernie Sanders' playbook. Listen to them, hear their concerns, hear their problems. Even if it makes you uncomfortable, or even if they're downright incorrect. Stop writing them off because of who they support. You will find that there's probably a good bit of common ground, and a good number of places you can make progress with them. But YOU have to be willing to. Just because you don't like what they say means they're wrong and you should ignore it and shut them out. If Liberals don't realize this by 2018, the house will swing even more republican. And if they don't realize this by 2020, you'll get 4 more years of Trump or another conservative, and probably a republican congress. \n",

This is where it gets tough for me because he is a good person, but I really do believe that his love of guns is a kind of.. it's hard to put into words.. like a sort of willfully blind perversion. What I mean by this is that when he looks at his gun collection (which is huge) he sees instruments by which he excels at his sport. And to him they may fundamentally be merely that. However he also keeps guns for self-defense (obviously not the same instruments). What I believe he is blind to is the fundamental nature of the object, which is primarily an object of destruction. That's why guns were invented, and that is primarily how guns are used and primarily how they are marketed. Yes there are sportsman such as my friend who only shoot clay pigeons, yes, they are not bad people, but they ARE missing something fundamental about their tools. They are missing their *point* which is to *destroy*. Loving instruments of destruction is bizarre to me. In the best of all possible cases (which I would argue is a small percentage of cases) the intent of the destruction is strictly limited to inanimate objects, but this is destruction which is a conceptual stand-in for animate destruction. Clay pigeons used to be real pigeons after all. There needs to be reckoning in gun culture about this. To not acknowledge the *fundamental* purpose of the objects you love is to be in a form of bad faith.\n",

I feel accomplished and I feel endorphins, but my heart will be racing, I'll be breathing heavily, and my legs will be sore.  Exercising is not supposed to be \"comfortable\".  \n",

But the fact of the matter is, even if that person is healthy in that moment, they are at a much, much higher risk of the most-common causes of death in the United States.  At the end of the day, someone is far, far likelier to lead a healthier life if they are not overweight, and the unfortunate truth is that in the vast, vast, VAST majority of cases, a person's weight is in their own control.\n",

That might sound insensitive, but it's the truth. (https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/causes.html).  This is a source that actually cites peer-reviewed science.\n",
